# The Bible Project

The Bible app will allow a user to browse and search the ESV Bible. The content will be text, video and audio. This part will not require a user login. The three APIs that will provide the data will be **api.nlt.to/api , https://biblebrain.com and api.esv.org.**

The login portion of the web site will allow a user to save Bible verses and journal about that verse. 

## Stretch Goals:
- A recommended book list linked to Amazon API
- User profile view, change password
- Search for a local church, google maps api
- Add support for NLT, NASB, New King James, King James
